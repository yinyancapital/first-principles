## time — first principles

### Start with the basic truths
1. **Everything happens in a sequence.**  
   There is always a before and after.
2. **You can’t stop or store time.**  
   You only decide how to use it.
3. **How you use time creates results.**  
   Good use brings growth. Poor use brings loss.

### What is time (first principles)?

**Time = the order in which things happen.**  
It is the **limited space** where life and work occur.

### How time connects to capital

**Capital** is resources used to build.  
**Time** is one of the most important resources.

### How time connects to money

- Money can be **earned by time** (working).
- Money can be **saved by time** (planning).
- Money can be **lost by time** (waste).

### How time connects to Yin and Yang

- **Yin** = slow, patient, steady time  
- **Yang** = fast, active, energetic time  

Both are needed:
- **Yin time** helps you plan and recover.  
- **Yang time** helps you act and grow.

### Simple example

You have **1 hour**:
- **30 minutes** to plan (Yin)  
- **30 minutes** to act (Yang)  

Now the hour creates real progress.
