# value.

## start with the basic truths
i. **needs create importance.**  
   things matter because they help or harm survival and goals.

ii. **scarcity increases worth.**  
   limited things are valued more.

iii. **choice reveals preference.**  
   what you select shows what you value.

iv. **context shapes value.**  
   the same thing can matter more or less depending on the situation.

## why value matters

- it **drives exchange**  
- it **creates motivation**

## a simple example

question: *why is water more valuable in a desert than in a city?*

first principles:
- survival need is higher  
- scarcity is greater  
- options are fewer  

so water’s value rises because **need and scarcity increase its importance.**
