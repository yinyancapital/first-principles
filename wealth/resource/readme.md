# resource.

## start with the basic truths
i. **action requires inputs.**  
   nothing is done without something to use.

ii. **scarcity creates limits.**  
   finite supplies constrain choices.

iii. **utility defines usefulness.**  
   a thing is a resource if it enables a goal.

iv. **control matters.**  
   access determines who can use value.

## what is a resource?

**resource** = **anything usable that enables action toward a goal.**  
it is potential turned into capability.

---

## how resources form

1. **identify a need**  
   determine what must be enabled.

2. **find usable inputs**  
   locate materials, energy, time, or knowledge.

3. **secure access**  
   gain control or rights to use them.

4. **apply to action**  
   convert inputs into outcomes.

## why resources matter

- they **make action possible**  
- they **expand choices**  
- they **limit or enable growth**  
- they **shape power and opportunity**

## a simple example

question: *why is time a resource?*

first principles:
- actions require duration  
- time is finite  
- more time enables more choices  

so time is a resource because it **enables action and limits what can be done.**

## resource summary

**resource = usable input → enabled action.**  
when something can be used to achieve a goal, it is a resource.
