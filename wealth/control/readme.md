# control.

## start with the basic truths
i. **systems tend toward drift.**  
   without guidance, outcomes diverge.

ii. **feedback enables correction.**  
   sensing change allows adjustment.

iii. **constraints shape behavior.**  
   limits and rules direct what is possible.

iv. **agency requires influence.**  
   control exists when action can change outcomes.

## what is control?

**control** = **the capacity to influence a system’s behavior toward a desired state.**  
it is guided causation.

---

## how control forms

1. **set a target**  
   define the state you want.

2. **observe the system**  
   gather feedback about current behavior.

3. **apply influence**  
   use actions or rules to shift direction.

4. **correct and stabilize**  
   adjust continuously to reduce drift.

## why control matters

- it **reduces randomness**  
- it **aligns outcomes with intent**  
- it **protects against instability**  
- it **enables reliable function**

## a simple example

question: *why is a thermostat control, not just measurement?*

first principles:
- a target temperature is set  
- sensors measure current state  
- the system adjusts heat to close the gap  

so control exists because **feedback plus action guides the system toward a goal.**

---

## control summary

**control = target + feedback + influence → guided stability.**  
when you can steer outcomes, you have control.
