# time.

## start with the basic truths
i. **time moves in one direction.**  
   you can’t stop or reverse it.

ii. **time is finite.**  
   every day has a limit.

iii. **attention turns time into value.**  
   time alone doesn’t create results.

iv. **trade‑offs are unavoidable.**  
   choosing one use means refusing another.

## a simple example

you have one free hour:
- 30 minutes to learn  
- 30 minutes to build  

now the hour creates growth instead of fading away.

## first principles summary

**time = the fixed window for action.**  
use it with attention, and value compounds.  
waste it, and it’s gone forever.
