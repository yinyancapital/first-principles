# asset.

## start with the basic truths
i. **an asset produces value.**  
   it gives more than it costs.

ii. **an asset can be owned or controlled.**  
   it’s a resource you can direct.

iii. **an asset has upkeep.**  
   without care, it decays.

iv. **assets create leverage.**  
   they multiply what you can do.

## a simple example

you build a simple product:
- it solves a real problem  
- it sells without extra effort  

now it generates value while you sleep.

build it, maintain it, and it multiplies.  
neglect it, and it weakens.
