# wealth.

## start with the basic truths
i. **resources enable action.**  
   without resources, choices are limited.

ii. **value is exchangeable.**  
   what others want can be traded.

iii. **time compounds outcomes.**  
   assets that persist can grow.

iv. **stability reduces risk.**  
   stored value protects against uncertainty.

## what is wealth?

**wealth** = **stored and controllable [value](./value/readme.md) that expands choices over time.**  
it is durable capacity to act.

---

## how wealth forms

1. **create value**  
   produce something others need or want.

2. **capture surplus**  
   keep more value than you consume.

3. **store or invest**  
   preserve value in assets that last or grow.

4. **protect and compound**  
   reduce loss and let time build more value.


## wealth building blocks

- [resource](./resource/readme.md)  
- [value](./value/readme.md)  
- [asset](./asset/readme.md)  
- [stock](./stock/readme.md)  
- [control](./control/readme.md)  
- [choice](./choice/readme.md)  
- [time](./time/readme.md)

## why wealth matters

- it **expands freedom of choice**  
- it **buffers uncertainty**  
- it **enables long‑term planning**  
- it **amplifies impact**

## a simple example

question: *why is a fruit tree wealth, not just food?*

first principles:
- the tree produces value repeatedly  
- it stores value in a durable asset  
- it reduces future scarcity  

so the tree is wealth because it **stores and multiplies value over time.**

---

## wealth summary

**wealth = stored value + time → expanded capacity.**  
when value endures, it becomes wealth.
