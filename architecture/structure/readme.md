# structure

## start with the basic truths
i. **parts exist before wholes.**  
   structure begins with elements.

ii. **relations create meaning.**  
   how parts connect matters as much as the parts themselves.

iii. **constraints shape outcomes.**  
   rules and limits determine stable forms.

iv. **order enables function.**  
   without arrangement, nothing coherent emerges.

## what is structure?

**structure** = **an organized arrangement of parts and relations that holds a system together and enables function.**

---

## how structure forms

1. **identify elements**  
   find the basic parts of the system.

2. **define relationships**  
   specify how parts connect, depend, or interact.

3. **apply constraints**  
   set rules that limit and stabilize connections.

4. **create coherence**  
   the arrangement becomes a whole with purpose.

## why structure matters

- it **creates stability** in complex systems  
- it **enables function** by organizing interactions  
- it **reduces chaos** by imposing order  
- it **reveals meaning** through relationships

## a simple example

question: *what makes a sentence a structure, not just words?*

first principles:
- words are elements  
- grammar is the relationship system  
- syntax rules constrain combinations  
- order creates meaning  

so a sentence is structured because its **parts and relations** form a coherent whole.

## structure summary

**structure = ordered parts + relationships + constraints → a stable, functional whole.**  
find the parts and their relations, and you see the structure.
