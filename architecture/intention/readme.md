# intention — from first principles

## start with the basic truths
i. **choice precedes action.**  
   intention is the moment before doing.

ii. **attention is finite.**  
   what you intend selects what you focus on.

iii. **goals shape behavior.**  
   intention points action in a direction.

iv. **commitment stabilizes action.**  
   without intent, actions drift.

## what is intention?

**intention** = **a conscious commitment to pursue a specific aim.**  
it is the chosen direction behind action.

---

## how intention forms

1. **recognize a desire or need**  
   something becomes worth pursuing.

2. **select a target**  
   decide what you will act toward.

3. **commit mentally**  
   align attention and energy with the target.

4. **translate into action**  
   intention becomes behavior.

## why intention matters

- it **focuses attention**  
- it **turns desire into direction**  
- it **makes action coherent**  
- it **creates accountability**

## a simple example

question: *why does “wanting” differ from “intending”?*

first principles:
- wanting is passive  
- intending is a committed choice  
- commitment organizes action  

so intention is different because it **binds desire to a chosen direction.**

## intention summary

**intention = choice + commitment → directed action.**  
when you intend, you act with purpose.
