# architecture.

## start with the basic truths
i. **purpose comes first.**  
   any architecture exists to serve a goal.

ii. **constraints are unavoidable.**  
   space, materials, energy, time, or rules shape what is possible.

iii. **parts must relate.**  
   components gain meaning through their connections.

iv. **form must hold function.**  
   structure must support use, flow, and stability.

## what is architecture?

**architecture** = **the deliberate organization of parts, relationships, and constraints to serve a purpose.**  
it is [structure](./structure/readme.md) with [intention](./intention/readme.md).

## how architecture forms

1. **define purpose**  
   decide what the system must achieve.

2. **map the elements**  
   identify the essential parts.

3. **shape relationships**  
   connect parts to enable flow and function.

4. **apply constraints**  
   use limits to guide stable, feasible form.

5. **create coherence**  
   the whole becomes usable, durable, and clear.


## architecture building blocks

- [intention](./intention/readme.md)  
- [plan](./plan/readme.md)  
- [structure](./structure/readme.md)

## why architecture matters

- it **turns intention into structure**  
- it **makes complexity workable**  
- it **guides adaptation** under constraints  
- it **creates stability and flow**

## a simple example

question: *why is a room layout architecture, not just furniture?*

first principles:
- the room has a purpose (rest, work, meeting)  
- elements exist (walls, openings, furniture)  
- relationships create flow (movement, access, light)  
- constraints shape choices (space, safety, cost)

so layout becomes architecture when it **organizes parts to serve purpose under constraints.**

---

## architecture summary

**architecture = purpose + parts + relationships + constraints → coherent form.**  
when structure serves intention, it becomes architecture.
