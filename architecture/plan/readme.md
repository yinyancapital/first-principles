# plan.

## start with the basic truths
i. **goals need paths.**  
   a desired outcome requires steps.

ii. **uncertainty must be managed.**  
   we reduce risk by thinking ahead.

iii. **resources are limited.**  
   time, energy, and tools must be allocated.

iv. **order creates efficiency.**  
   sequence prevents waste and confusion.

## what is a plan?

**plan** = **a structured sequence of actions and resource choices designed to reach a goal under constraints.**  
it is intention made actionable.

---

## how a plan forms

1. **define the goal**  
   clarify what must be achieved.

2. **map the steps**  
   break the goal into actions.

3. **assign resources**  
   decide what each step requires.

4. **sequence and timing**  
   arrange steps to reduce friction.

5. **set checkpoints**  
   create feedback points to adapt.

## why plans matter

- they **turn goals into action**  
- they **reduce uncertainty**  
- they **coordinate people and resources**  
- they **enable progress tracking**

## a simple example

question: *why is “studying weekly” a plan, not just a wish?*

first principles:
- the goal is defined (learn the subject)  
- steps exist (read, practice, review)  
- time is allocated each week  
- feedback (tests) adjusts direction  

so it’s a plan because it **organizes action toward a goal.**

## plan summary

**plan = goal + steps + resources + sequence → directed progress.**  
when intention gains structure, it becomes a plan.
