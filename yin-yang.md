# yin and yang — first principles

## start with the basic truths
i. **everything changes.**  
   nothing stays the same forever.
   
ii. **opposites exist in most systems.**  
   like night/day, rest/work, saving/spending.
   
iii. **opposites depend on each other.**  
   you can’t have one without the other.
   
iv. **balance creates stability and growth.**  
   too much of one side causes imbalance.
