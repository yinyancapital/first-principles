## Yin and Yang — First Principles Explanation

### Start with the basic truths
1. **Everything changes.**  
   Nothing stays the same forever.
2. **Many things have two opposite parts.**  
   Like day and night, hot and cold, quiet and loud.
3. **Opposites are connected, not enemies.**  
   You can’t have “up” without “down.”

### So what is Yin and Yang?

**Yin and Yang** is a way to explain how **opposites work together** to create balance.

- **Yin** = the calm, dark, quiet, cool side  
- **Yang** = the active, bright, loud, warm side  

They are **different**, but they **depend on each other**.

### A simple example

- **Day** is Yang  
- **Night** is Yin  

You need both for a full day.

### First principles summary
