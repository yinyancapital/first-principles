# an idea — from first principles

## start with the basic truths
i. **minds receive raw signals.**  
   perception, memory, and data are the raw inputs.

ii. **brains compress [reality](./reality/readme.md).**  
   they look for [pattern](./pattern/readme.md)s and reduce complexity.

iii. **[pattern](./pattern/readme.md)s become [model](./model/readme.md)s.**  
   the mind stores compressed patterns as usable units.

iv. **[model](./model/readme.md)s guide action.**  
   what you can model, you can predict, choose, or build.

## what is an idea?

**an idea** = **a compressed, manipulable [model](./model/readme.md) of [reality](./reality/readme.md) (or possibility).**  
it is a [pattern](./pattern/readme.md) you can hold, reuse, and reshape.

## how ideas form

1. **collect signals**  
   experience generates raw information.

2. **find regularities**  
   the mind detects recurring structure.

3. **compress into a concept**  
   the pattern becomes a single mental unit.

4. **apply or combine**  
   the unit can be tested, shared, or remixed.


## idea building blocks

- [reality](./reality/readme.md)  
- [mind](./mind/readme.md)  
- [pattern](./pattern/readme.md)  
- [model](./model/readme.md)

## why ideas matter

- they **reduce complexity** so you can think clearly  
- they **enable creativity** by recombining patterns  
- they **make communication possible** between minds  
- they **drive action** by guiding prediction and choice

## a simple example

question: *why is “fire” an idea, not just a memory?*

first principles:
- many experiences with heat, light, and danger repeat  
- the mind compresses those patterns into one unit  
- that unit becomes a concept you can reuse  

so “fire” is an idea because it is a **pattern model**, not a single event.

---

## idea summary

**an idea = a portable pattern of reality.**  
find the pattern, and you hold the idea.
