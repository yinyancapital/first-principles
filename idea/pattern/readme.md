# pattern.

## start with the basic truths
i. **events are not purely random.**  
   regularities appear across time and context.

ii. **similarity can be detected.**  
   minds and systems can recognize repeated structure.

iii. **repetition enables compression.**  
   recurring forms can be represented as one unit.

iv. **recognized structure guides prediction.**  
   what repeats can often be anticipated.

## what is a pattern?

**pattern** = **a recurring structure or relationship that appears across observations.**  
it is repeated order within variation.

---

## how patterns form

1. **observe multiple instances**  
   gather examples across situations.

2. **detect regularities**  
   find what repeats.

3. **separate signal from noise**  
   keep stable structure, discard accidental variation.

4. **encode the regularity**  
   store it as a reusable concept.

5. **apply to prediction**  
   use the pattern to anticipate outcomes.

## why patterns matter

- they **reduce cognitive load**  
- they **enable fast recognition**  
- they **support model-building**  
- they **improve forecasting**

## a simple example

question: *why does traffic often worsen at the same hour?*

first principles:
- many people move on similar schedules  
- repeated timing creates repeated congestion  
- repetition makes future congestion predictable

so traffic timing is a pattern because it **repeats with enough structure to predict.**

---

## pattern summary

**pattern = repeated structure recognized across instances.**  
when regularity is found, prediction becomes possible.
