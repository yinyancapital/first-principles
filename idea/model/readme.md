# model.

## start with the basic truths
i. **reality is too complex to hold in full.**  
   minds and systems need simplification.

ii. **abstraction preserves useful structure.**  
   a good simplification keeps what matters.

iii. **prediction tests quality.**  
   models prove value by forecasting outcomes.

iv. **feedback updates fit.**  
   models improve when corrected by results.

## what is a model?

**model** = **a simplified representation of reality used to explain, predict, or decide.**  
it is a usable map, not the territory.

---

## how models form

1. **choose a scope**  
   decide what part of reality to represent.

2. **identify key variables**  
   keep the factors that drive outcomes.

3. **define relationships**  
   specify how variables interact.

4. **test predictions**  
   compare model outputs to real outcomes.

5. **refine continuously**  
   adjust assumptions as evidence grows.

## why models matter

- they **make complexity tractable**  
- they **support better forecasts**  
- they **guide decisions under uncertainty**  
- they **enable shared reasoning**

## a simple example

question: *why is a weather forecast a model?*

first principles:
- atmosphere is complex  
- key variables are selected and related  
- predictions are tested against actual weather

so a forecast is a model because it **simplifies reality to predict useful outcomes.**

## model summary

**model = selective abstraction + tested relationships → usable prediction.**  
better models mean better decisions.
