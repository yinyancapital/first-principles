# predict.

## start with the basic truths
i. **future states depend on present structure.**  
   what happens next is constrained by what exists now.

ii. **patterns carry forward information.**  
   recurring relationships enable expectation.

iii. **uncertainty is unavoidable.**  
   prediction estimates likelihood, not certainty.

iv. **feedback improves forecasts.**  
   comparing outcomes to estimates sharpens models.

## what is predict?

**predict** = **to estimate a future outcome from current information, structure, and learned patterns.**  
it is reasoned anticipation under uncertainty.

---

## how prediction works

1. **observe current state**  
   gather relevant variables and constraints.

2. **apply a model**  
   use relationships to project forward.

3. **estimate outcomes**  
   generate likely results and ranges.

4. **act on expectation**  
   choose decisions based on projected consequences.

5. **compare and update**  
   measure forecast error and refine the model.

## why prediction matters

- it **guides proactive decisions**  
- it **reduces avoidable risk**  
- it **improves planning under limits**  
- it **turns models into practical value**

## a simple example

question: *why carry an umbrella when skies are still clear?*

first principles:
- weather signals indicate probable rain  
- forecast models project near-term conditions  
- acting early avoids future cost

so prediction matters because it **lets present action account for likely future states.**

## predict summary

**predict = model + current state + uncertainty → expected future.**  
better prediction creates better timing and choices.
