# reality.

## start with the basic truths
i. **something exists independent of preference.**  
   the world is not created by our wishes.

ii. **constraints are real.**  
   limits, causality, and tradeoffs shape outcomes.

iii. **observation reveals structure.**  
   patterns in experience point to what is true.

iv. **models can be wrong.**  
   reality is the test that corrects belief.

## what is reality?

**reality** = **the way things are, independent of what we want them to be.**  
it is the ground truth all thinking must face.

---

## how reality is engaged

1. **observe what is**  
   notice facts, signals, and constraints.

2. **test assumptions**  
   compare beliefs against evidence.

3. **update understanding**  
   keep what matches; revise what fails.

4. **act within constraints**  
   choose actions that fit the real structure.

## why reality matters

- it **sets the boundary of what works**  
- it **prevents self-deception**  
- it **anchors accurate models**  
- it **improves decision quality**

## a simple example

question: *why can’t confidence alone make a bridge safe?*

first principles:
- materials obey physical laws  
- loads and stress are real constraints  
- ignoring constraints causes failure

so reality matters because it **enforces consequences regardless of belief.**

## reality summary

**reality = objective constraints + observable structure.**  
clear thinking starts by facing what is true.
