# mind.

## start with the basic truths
i. **experience arrives as signals.**  
   sensation, memory, and language feed cognition.

ii. **attention is limited.**  
   the mind must select what to process.

iii. **compression enables thinking.**  
   concepts reduce complexity into usable units.

iv. **interpretation shapes action.**  
   how the mind frames reality guides decisions.

## what is mind?

**mind** = **the system that perceives, interprets, models, and directs action.**  
it is the internal engine of understanding.

## how mind works

1. **perceive signals**  
   receive inputs from world and memory.

2. **filter and prioritize**  
   allocate attention to what seems relevant.

3. **form internal models**  
   organize patterns into concepts.

4. **choose and act**  
   use models to predict and decide.

5. **learn through feedback**  
   update models from outcomes.

## why mind matters

- it **turns data into meaning**  
- it **creates models for prediction**  
- it **guides behavior under uncertainty**  
- it **enables reflection and revision**

## a simple example

question: *why do two people see the same event differently?*

first principles:
- both receive similar signals  
- each filters through different priors  
- interpretation changes conclusion

so the mind matters because it **transforms raw input into framed meaning.**

## mind summary

**mind = perception + interpretation + model-building → directed action.**  
how you think determines how you act.
