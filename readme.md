# first principles.

A simple map for understanding complex life systems.

## start with the basic truths

i. **complex things are built from simple parts.**  
   to understand a system, find its smallest pieces.

ii. **assumptions can hide reality.**  
   inherited ideas may be wrong or incomplete.

iii. **truth is discovered by asking "why."**  
   deep questions reveal deeper structure.

iv. **clarity creates better decisions.**  
   when you see the basics, you choose better actions.

## what are first principles?

**first principles** = **the most basic truths you can’t reduce further.**  
they are the foundation beneath all explanations.

---

## how first principles work

1. **break things down**  
   reduce a problem to its simplest parts.

2. **test each part**  
   ask "is this true?" not "is this common?"

3. **build upward**  
   recombine the truths into a new, clearer model.

## read this project from beginning to end

1. **[philosophy](./philosophy/readme.md)** — how to think clearly and test meaning.  
2. **[idea](./idea/readme.md)** — how mind turns reality into models.  
3. **[architecture](./architecture/readme.md)** — how to organize parts with intention.  
4. **[capital](./capital/readme.md)** — the resources that make building possible.  
5. **[wealth](./wealth/readme.md)** — how value is stored, protected, and compounded.  
6. **[yin yang](./yin%20yang/readme.md)** — balancing opposing forces for sustainability.

This order gives context first, then action, then compounding.

## meaning optimization (simple version)

Use these filters while reading any page in this repo:

- **define** the term in one plain sentence.
- **reduce** the idea to 3–4 non-negotiable truths.
- **connect** each truth to a practical action.
- **test** with one everyday example.
- **summarize** in one short formula.

If a section cannot pass these filters, simplify it again.

## why first principles matter

- they **remove noise** from complex problems  
- they **challenge tradition** and weak assumptions  
- they **unlock new solutions**  
- they **help you explain things simply**

## a simple example

question: *why does a small daily habit beat big bursts of effort?*

first principles:
- outcomes come from repeated actions  
- repeated actions are easier when they are small  
- small actions lower resistance  
- lower resistance makes consistency possible

so small habits win because they make consistency easy.

## first principles summary

**first principles = the simplest truths beneath everything.**  
find them, and you see clearly.
