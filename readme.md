# first principles — as a concept

## start with the basic truths
i. **complex things are built from simple parts.**  
   to understand a system, find its smallest pieces.

ii. **assumptions can hide reality.**  
   inherited ideas may be wrong or incomplete.

iii. **truth is discovered by asking “why.”**  
   deep questions reveal deeper structure.

iv. **clarity creates better decisions.**  
   when you see the basics, you choose better actions.

## what are first principles?

**first principles** = **the most basic truths you can’t reduce further.**  
they are the foundation beneath all explanations.

## how first principles work

1. **break things down**  
   reduce a problem to its simplest parts.

2. **test each part**  
   ask “is this true?” not “is this common?”

3. **build upward**  
   recombine the truths into a new, clearer model.

## why first principles matter

- they **remove noise** from complex problems  
- they **challenge tradition** and weak assumptions  
- they **unlock new solutions**  
- they **help you explain things simply**

## a simple example

question: *why does a small daily habit beat big bursts of effort?*

first principles:
- outcomes come from repeated actions  
- repeated actions are easier when they are small  
- small actions lower resistance  
- lower resistance makes consistency possible  

so small habits win because they make consistency easy.
