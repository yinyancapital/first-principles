# yin yang

## start with the basic truths
i. **all systems have opposing forces.**  
   one pushes; one receives.

ii. **balance creates stability.**  
   too much of either breaks the system.

iii. **yin and yang depend on each other.**  
   each gives the other meaning.

iv. **movement comes from their interplay.**  
   change happens through tension and balance.
