# yin — first principles

## start with the basic truths
i. **life moves in cycles.**  
   there is rise and fall, day and night.

ii. **every system needs balance.**  
   too much force breaks; too little stalls.

iii. **yin is the receptive side.**  
   it is rest, depth, and inward strength.

iv. **yin makes renewal possible.**  
   without it, growth burns out.
