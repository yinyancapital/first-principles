# capital — first principles

## start with the basic truths
(i). **people want to build things.**  
   homes, businesses, ideas, and systems.

(ii). **building needs resources.**  
   [time](./%28xi%29.%20time/readme.md), [tools](./%28ix%29.%20tools/readme.md), [money](./%28xiii%29.%20money/readme.md), [skills](./%28vi%29.%20skills/readme.md), and [energy](./%28i%29.%20energy/readme.md).

(iii). **resources are limited.**  
   so how you use them matters.

(iv). **growth comes from wise use.**  
   waste shrinks capital, smart use grows it.

## capital across key life resources

### time
- **capital use** = learning, building, creating  
- **capital loss** = delay, drift, waste  

### money
- **capital use** = investing in growth  
- **capital loss** = spending without return  

### skills
- **capital use** = improving ability to create value  
- **capital loss** = letting skills decay  

### knowledge
- **capital use** = making smarter choices  
- **capital loss** = ignoring what you know  

### tools
- **capital use** = multiplying effort  
- **capital loss** = unused or broken tools  

### relationships
- **capital use** = trust, cooperation, support  
- **capital loss** = conflict, isolation  

### networks
- **capital use** = access to opportunities  
- **capital loss** = weak or inactive connections  

### energy
- **capital use** = focused effort and momentum  
- **capital loss** = exhaustion and burnout  

### health
- **capital use** = strength to work and recover  
- **capital loss** = neglect and sickness  

### systems
- **capital use** = repeatable success  
- **capital loss** = chaos and inconsistency  

### processes
- **capital use** = smooth execution  
- **capital loss** = friction and errors  

### trust

## a simple example

you run a small service:
- reinvest part of profit into better tools  
- document your process to save time  
- keep promises so people refer you  

now money, systems, and trust compound into stronger capital.

## first principles summary

**capital = resources used to build.**  
use them well, and they grow.  
use them poorly, and they shrink.
