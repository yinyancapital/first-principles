# capital — first principles

## start with the basic truths
(i). **people want to build things.**  
   homes, businesses, ideas, and systems.

(ii). **building needs resources.**  
   time, tools, money, skills, and energy.

(iii). **resources are limited.**  
   so how you use them matters.

(iv). **growth comes from wise use.**  
   waste shrinks capital, smart use grows it.

- **capital loss** = unused or broken tools  

### relationships

## a simple example

you run a small service:
- reinvest part of profit into better tools  
- document your process to save time  
- keep promises so people refer you  

now money, systems, and trust compound into stronger capital.

## first principles summary

**capital = resources used to build.**  
use them well, and they grow.  
use them poorly, and they shrink.
