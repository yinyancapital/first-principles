# energy — first principles

## start with the basic truths
i. **everything you do requires energy.**  
   without it, nothing moves.

ii. **energy is finite each day.**  
   you spend it whether you plan or not.

iii. **energy can be restored.**  
   rest, food, and recovery refill it.

iv. **where you place energy shapes outcomes.**  
   focused energy builds; scattered energy drains.

## what is energy (first principles)?

**energy** = **the capacity to act, focus, and sustain effort.**

it comes from:
• rest  
• nutrition  
• movement  
• meaning

## energy across key life resources

### time
- **energy use** = working in focused blocks  
- **energy loss** = multitasking and drift  

### money
- **energy use** = earning with intention  
- **energy loss** = spending on stress  

### skills
- **energy use** = deliberate practice  
- **energy loss** = shallow repetition  

### knowledge
- **energy use** = deep study and reflection  
- **energy loss** = passive consumption  

### tools
- **energy use** = automation and leverage  
- **energy loss** = manual overload  

### relationships
- **energy use** = presence and care  
- **energy loss** = constant conflict  

### networks
- **energy use** = supporting and contributing  
- **energy loss** = overextending  

### health
- **energy use** = movement and recovery  
- **energy loss** = neglect and sleep debt  

### capital
- **energy use** = building with momentum  
- **energy loss** = burnout and stalls

## a simple example

you have a long week:
- sleep an extra hour  
- protect two deep‑work blocks  

now energy rises and output improves.

## first principles summary

**energy = the capacity to act and sustain effort.**  
protect it, and progress accelerates.  
waste it, and everything slows.
