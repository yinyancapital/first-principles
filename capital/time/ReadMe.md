# time — first principles

## start with the basic truths
i. **everything happens in sequence.**  
   there is always a before and after.

ii. **you can’t stop or store time.**  
   you only decide how to use it.

iii. **how you use time creates results.**  
   good use brings growth. poor use brings loss.

iv. **time is limited.**  
   so every choice matters.
