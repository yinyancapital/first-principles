# tools — first principles

## start with the basic truths
i. **people use tools to multiply effort.**  
   tools let one person do more.

ii. **a good tool saves time and energy.**  
   a bad tool wastes both.

iii. **tools require skill to use well.**  
   the tool and the user grow together.

iv. **unused tools lose value.**  
   if you don’t use them, they don’t help you.
