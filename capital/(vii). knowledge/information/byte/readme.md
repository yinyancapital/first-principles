# byte.

## start with the basic truths
i. **bits gain power in groups.**  
   multiple binary choices create richer meaning.

ii. **standard sizes reduce confusion.**  
   shared conventions make systems interoperable.

iii. **patterns encode symbols.**  
   combinations can represent numbers, letters, or instructions.

iv. **structure enables efficiency.**  
   fixed units simplify storage and processing.

## what is a byte?

**byte** = **a standard unit of data made of 8 bits, used to represent a single symbol or small value.**  
it is a compact packet of information.

## how bytes work

1. **combine bits**  
   group 8 binary states.

2. **map patterns to meaning**  
   define what each 8‑bit pattern represents.

3. **store or transmit**  
   move bytes through memory, files, or networks.

4. **build larger structures**  
   bytes compose words, images, and programs.

## why bytes matter

- they **standardize data representation**  
- they **enable text and numbers**  
- they **simplify storage and transfer**  
- they **build the foundation of computing**

## a simple example

question: *why is the letter “A” a byte?*

first principles:
- the system assigns a pattern to “A” (e.g., 01000001)  
- that pattern fits in 8 bits  
- the machine interprets the pattern as a letter  

so “A” is a byte because it **uses 8 bits to encode one symbol.**

## byte summary

**byte = 8 bits → a standard unit of data.**  
when 8 binary choices form a pattern, you have a byte.
