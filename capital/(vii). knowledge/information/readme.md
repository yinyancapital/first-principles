# information.

## start with the basic truths
i. **difference is detectable.**  
   without distinction, nothing can be known.

ii. **signals carry patterns.**  
   patterns can represent something else.

iii. **context gives meaning.**  
   the same signal can mean different things.

iv. **constraints shape interpretation.**  
   limits determine what can be transmitted and understood.

## what is information?

**information** = **a pattern that reduces uncertainty for a receiver.**  
it is difference that makes a difference.

## how information forms

1. **create a distinction**  
   encode a difference in a signal or state.

2. **choose a representation**  
   map the distinction to symbols, data, or signs.

3. **transmit or store**  
   carry the pattern across time or space.

4. **interpret in context**  
   a receiver maps the pattern to meaning.

## why information matters

- it **reduces uncertainty**  
- it **enables decision‑making**  
- it **coordinates systems**  
- it **creates knowledge**

## a simple example

question: *why is a traffic light information, not just color?*

first principles:
- colors are distinct signals  
- the system maps colors to actions  
- the driver interprets within that context  

so the light is information because it **reduces uncertainty about what to do.**

## information summary

**information = pattern + context → reduced uncertainty.**  
when a signal changes what you know, it becomes information.
