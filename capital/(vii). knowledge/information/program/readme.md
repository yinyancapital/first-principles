# program.

## start with the basic truths
i. **tasks require sequences.**  
   goals are reached through ordered steps.

ii. **machines execute rules.**  
   instructions shape behavior.

iii. **logic enables predictability.**  
   consistent rules produce consistent outcomes.

iv. **abstraction manages complexity.**  
   we group steps into reusable structures.

## what is a program?

**program** = **a structured set of instructions that directs a system to perform a task.**  
it is a blueprint for behavior.

---

## how programs form

1. **define the task**  
   clarify what must be done.

2. **design the logic**  
   specify steps, conditions, and flow.

3. **encode the instructions**  
   express logic in a formal language.

4. **execute and observe**  
   run the program and check results.

## why programs matter

- they **automate tasks**  
- they **make behavior repeatable**  
- they **scale human intent**  
- they **create complex systems**

## a simple example

question: *why is a recipe a program?*

first principles:
- it defines a goal (a dish)  
- it lists ordered steps  
- it includes conditions (if too dry, add water)  
- it produces repeatable outcomes  

so a recipe is a program because it **encodes instructions for reliable action.**

## program summary

**program = goal + logic + instructions → repeatable behavior.**  
when steps are formalized, you have a program.
