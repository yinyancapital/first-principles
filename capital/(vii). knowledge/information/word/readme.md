# word.

## start with the basic truths
i. **humans need shared symbols.**  
   coordination requires common signs.

ii. **sounds and marks can represent ideas.**  
   patterns can carry meaning.

iii. **context shapes interpretation.**  
   the same word can mean different things.

iv. **agreement creates stability.**  
   a word works when many share its meaning.

## what is a word?

**word** = **a shared symbol that points to a concept, object, or action.**  
it is meaning encoded in sound or text.

---

## how words form

1. **choose a sound or mark**  
   create a distinct symbol.

2. **attach meaning**  
   link the symbol to a concept.

3. **share and repeat**  
   spread the symbol through use.

4. **stabilize by convention**  
   repeated use fixes meaning in a community.

## why words matter

- they **enable communication**  
- they **compress complex ideas**  
- they **coordinate action**  
- they **build culture and memory**

## a simple example

question: *why is “fire” a word, not just a sound?*

first principles:
- the sound is distinct  
- a community links it to a dangerous phenomenon  
- hearing it changes behavior  

so “fire” is a word because it **carries shared meaning that guides action.**

## word summary

**word = symbol + shared meaning → communication.**  
when a sound or mark carries agreed meaning, it becomes a word.
