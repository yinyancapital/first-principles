# bit.

## start with the basic truths
i. **difference can be encoded.**  
   a system can represent two distinct states.

ii. **choices reduce uncertainty.**  
   knowing which state holds conveys information.

iii. **signals need limits.**  
   discrete states are stable and reliable.

iv. **complexity is built from units.**  
   larger meanings emerge from simple elements.

## what is a bit?

**bit** = **the smallest unit of information, representing one of two possible states.**  
it is a single binary choice.

---

## how bits work

1. **define two states**  
   e.g., 0/1, off/on, yes/no.

2. **encode a distinction**  
   choose which state represents the signal.

3. **store or transmit**  
   keep the state in memory or send it.

4. **interpret the state**  
   map it to meaning in context.

## why bits matter

- they **enable digital representation**  
- they **scale into complex data**  
- they **support reliable computation**  
- they **compress uncertainty into choice**

## a simple example

question: *why is a light switch a bit?*

first principles:
- it has two stable states  
- each state can represent a choice  
- that choice conveys information  

so the switch is a bit because it **stores one binary distinction.**

## bit summary

**bit = one binary state → one unit of information.**  
when a system can be in one of two states, it can carry a bit.
