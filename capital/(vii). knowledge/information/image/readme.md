# image.

## start with the basic truths
i. **vision detects patterns of light.**  
   differences in light create perceived forms.

ii. **surfaces reflect information.**  
   light carries structure from the world.

iii. **representation can be stored.**  
   patterns can be captured and reproduced.

iv. **context guides interpretation.**  
   what we see depends on meaning and expectation.

## what is an image?

**image** = **a structured pattern of visual information that represents something.**  
it is captured light organized into meaning.

## how images form

1. **capture light**  
   detect variations in brightness and color.

2. **encode the pattern**  
   represent the visual structure in a medium or data.

3. **store or transmit**  
   preserve the pattern across time or space.

4. **render for perception**  
   reconstruct the pattern for a viewer.

## why images matter

- they **compress complex scenes**  
- they **enable memory and communication**  
- they **shape perception and belief**  
- they **carry meaning without words**

## a simple example

question: *why is a photo an image, not just pixels?*

first principles:
- pixels encode light patterns  
- the pattern maps to a real scene  
- viewers interpret the pattern as representation  

so a photo is an image because it **encodes visual structure into meaning.**

## image summary

**image = light pattern + representation → visual meaning.**  
when light is structured and interpreted, it becomes an image.
