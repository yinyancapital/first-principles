# software engineering.

## start with the basic truths
i. **software is built, not found.**  
   it requires intentional design and construction.

ii. **complexity grows with scale.**  
   larger systems need structure to remain reliable.

iii. **change is inevitable.**  
   software must adapt over time.

iv. **collaboration demands clarity.**  
   teams need shared rules and processes.

## what is software engineering?

**software engineering** = **the disciplined practice of designing, building, testing, and maintaining software systems.**  
it is applied rigor for reliable software.

---

## how software engineering works

1. **define requirements**  
   agree on what the system must do.

2. **design the system**  
   choose architecture, components, and interfaces.

3. **implement and test**  
   build features and verify correctness.

4. **maintain and evolve**  
   fix, improve, and adapt over time.

## why software engineering matters

- it **prevents chaos in complex systems**  
- it **improves quality and reliability**  
- it **enables teamwork and scale**  
- it **reduces long‑term cost**

## a simple example

question: *why isn’t “just coding” enough for a banking app?*

first principles:
- correctness is critical  
- failures are costly  
- multiple teams must coordinate  
- the system must evolve safely  

so software engineering is required because it **applies discipline to make software dependable.**

## software engineering summary

**software engineering = disciplined process → reliable software.**  
when building software at scale, engineering makes it work.
