# software.

## start with the basic truths
i. **problems need procedures.**  
   tasks are solved by ordered steps.

ii. **machines require instructions.**  
   hardware is inert without commands.

iii. **abstraction reduces complexity.**  
   we manage detail by layering concepts.

iv. **logic creates reliability.**  
   correct rules produce consistent outcomes.

## what is software?

**software** = **encoded logic that directs machines to perform tasks under defined rules.**  
it is organized instruction.

---

## how software forms

1. **define the task**  
   identify the problem to solve.

2. **design the logic**  
   create rules, flow, and decisions.

3. **encode in a language**  
   translate logic into machine‑executable form.

4. **test and refine**  
   correct errors and improve behavior.

## why software matters

- it **turns machines into tools**  
- it **scales human intent**  
- it **enables automation**  
- it **creates digital systems**

## a simple example

question: *why is a calculator app software, not just math?*

first principles:
- math is abstract  
- software encodes math into steps  
- the machine executes those steps  

so it is software because it **turns logic into executable instruction.**

## software summary

**software = logic + encoding + execution → useful behavior.**  
when logic runs on a machine, it becomes software.
