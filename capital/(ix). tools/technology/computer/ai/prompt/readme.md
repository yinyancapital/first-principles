# prompt.

## start with the basic truths
i. **models depend on input.**  
   what you ask shapes what the system can produce.

ii. **context constrains interpretation.**  
   background information narrows ambiguity.

iii. **instructions set objectives.**  
   explicit goals improve output alignment.

iv. **format guides response structure.**  
   requested form changes how results are organized.

## what is a prompt?

**prompt** = **the structured input (instruction, context, and constraints) that directs an ai model's [response](../response/readme.md).**  
it is task design through [language](../language/readme.md).

## how prompting works

1. **state the objective**  
   define what you want.

2. **provide context**  
   include relevant facts, data, and domain boundaries.

3. **add constraints**  
   specify style, length, format, and exclusions.

4. **set quality criteria**  
   describe what a good answer must include.

5. **iterate with feedback**  
   refine wording based on output quality.

## why prompts matter

- they **reduce ambiguity**  
- they **improve relevance**  
- they **increase reliability of outputs**  
- they **turn intent into executable model guidance**

## a simple example

question: *why is “explain photosynthesis” weaker than a detailed prompt?*

first principles:
- vague input leaves many possible outputs  
- constraints reduce uncertainty  
- clearer objectives improve alignment

so detailed prompting works better because it **constrains the model toward the intended result.**

---

## prompt summary

**prompt = objective + context + constraints → directed generation.**  
better prompts produce better-aligned responses.
