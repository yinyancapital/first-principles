# ai.

## start with the basic truths
i. **intelligence is pattern use.**  
   to act intelligently, a system must detect and apply patterns.

ii. **learning changes behavior.**  
   a system becomes more capable when experience updates its internal model.

iii. **goals require prediction.**  
   useful action depends on estimating what happens next.

iv. **language can coordinate reasoning.**  
   structured symbols let systems receive instructions and return useful outputs.

## what is ai?

**ai** = **a system that uses learned patterns to predict, decide, or generate outputs toward a goal.**  
it is statistical intelligence applied to tasks.

---

## how ai forms

1. **define a task and objective**  
   specify what success looks like.

2. **collect and structure data**  
   gather examples that encode useful patterns.

3. **train a model**  
   adjust parameters so the system maps inputs to better outputs.

4. **run inference**  
   apply the trained model to new inputs.

5. **evaluate and iterate**  
   measure errors, refine data, and improve behavior.

## ai breakdown for language interaction

for language systems, the core loop is:

1. [prompt](./prompt/readme.md)  
   the instruction/context given to the model.

2. internal pattern matching and prediction  
   the model estimates likely next tokens based on learned structure.

3. [response](./response/readme.md)  
   generated output intended to satisfy the prompt objective.

## why ai matters

- it **scales pattern-based decision support**  
- it **automates cognitive tasks**  
- it **amplifies human creativity and speed**  
- it **turns data into adaptive behavior**  

---

## a simple example

question: *why is autocomplete a form of ai?*

first principles:
- it learns language patterns from data  
- it predicts likely next words  
- prediction is used to assist action

so autocomplete is ai because it **uses learned patterns to generate goal-relevant output.**

---

## ai summary

**ai = learned patterns + objective + inference → adaptive output.**  
when a system learns from data and uses prediction to act, it is ai.
