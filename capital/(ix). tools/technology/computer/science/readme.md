# computer science.

## start with the basic truths
i. **problems can be formalized.**  
   tasks can be expressed as rules and symbols.

ii. **processes can be analyzed.**  
   steps have cost, limits, and structure.

iii. **information can be represented.**  
   data can be encoded, stored, and transformed.

iv. **systems can be built from abstractions.**  
   complex behavior emerges from layers.

## what is computer science?

**computer science** = **the study of computation: how information is represented, processed, and structured by algorithms and systems.**  
it is the science of formal problem‑solving.

## how computer science works

1. **define a problem**  
   express it in precise, formal terms.

2. **design an algorithm**  
   specify a method to solve it.

3. **analyze efficiency**  
   measure time, space, and limits.

4. **build systems**  
   implement and test computation in machines.

## why computer science matters

- it **creates reliable algorithms**  
- it **enables scalable systems**  
- it **reveals limits of computation**  
- it **drives digital innovation**

## a simple example

question: *why is sorting a list computer science?*

first principles:
- the task is formalized  
- an algorithm defines steps  
- efficiency can be analyzed  
- the method can be implemented  

so sorting is computer science because it **studies how computation achieves a goal.**

## computer science summary

**computer science = problems + algorithms + analysis → computation understood.**  
when we study how rules transform information, we do computer science.
