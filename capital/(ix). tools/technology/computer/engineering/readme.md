# computer engineering.

## start with the basic truths
i. **computation needs physical systems.**  
   logic must be realized in hardware.

ii. **signals can carry information.**  
   electrical states represent bits.

iii. **performance depends on design.**  
   speed, power, and reliability trade off.

iv. **integration creates capability.**  
   hardware and software must align.

## what is computer engineering?

**computer engineering** = **the discipline that designs and builds computing systems by integrating hardware and software.**  
it is computation made physical and practical.

## how computer engineering works

1. **specify the function**  
   define what the system must do.

2. **design the hardware**  
   build circuits to implement logic and storage.

3. **connect with software**  
   create firmware and interfaces to control behavior.

4. **optimize and validate**  
   balance performance, power, cost, and reliability.

## why computer engineering matters

- it **turns computation into devices**  
- it **bridges hardware and software**  
- it **enables efficient systems**  
- it **powers modern technology**

## a simple example

question: *why is a smartphone a computer‑engineering product?*

first principles:
- hardware implements logic and memory  
- software directs the hardware  
- the whole system is optimized for speed and power  

so a smartphone is computer engineering because it **integrates physical computation with software control.**

## computer engineering summary

**computer engineering = hardware + software → functional computation.**  
when logic is built into devices, computer engineering is at work.
