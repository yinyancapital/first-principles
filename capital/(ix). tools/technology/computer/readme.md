# computer.

## start with the basic truths
i. **information can be encoded.**  
   symbols can represent reality and rules.

ii. **logic can be mechanized.**  
   procedures can be executed by machines.

iii. **memory enables state.**  
   systems need storage to keep and use information.

iv. **inputs become outputs.**  
   transformation is the core of computation.

## what is a computer?

**computer** = **a machine that processes information by applying logic to inputs to produce outputs.**  
it is automated reasoning in hardware.

## how computers form

1. **encode information**  
   represent data in bits.

2. **store state**  
   keep data and instructions in memory.

3. **apply logic**  
   use operations to transform inputs.

4. **produce results**  
   output new information or action.

## why computers matter

- they **automate complex reasoning**  
- they **scale human problem‑solving**  
- they **process vast data quickly**  
- they **enable modern digital systems**

## a simple example

question: *why is a calculator a computer?*

first principles:
- it encodes numbers as data  
- it applies logical operations  
- it outputs computed results  

so a calculator is a computer because it **processes information by rule.**

## computer summary

**computer = information + logic + memory → automated computation.**  
when a machine transforms data by rules, it is a computer.
