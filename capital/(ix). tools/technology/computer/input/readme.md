# input.

## start with the basic truths
i. **systems need change to respond.**  
   without signals, nothing can be processed.

ii. **information enters through channels.**  
   data must cross a boundary to be used.

iii. **meaning depends on context.**  
   the same signal can imply different things.

iv. **choice begins with reception.**  
   action depends on what is taken in.

## what is input?

**input** = **information or energy entering a system that triggers or guides its behavior.**  
it is the starting signal for processing.

---

## how input works

1. **detect a signal**  
   sense data or energy from outside.

2. **encode the signal**  
   convert it into the system’s form.

3. **deliver to processing**  
   move it to where decisions are made.

4. **influence behavior**  
   let the signal change system state.

## why input matters

- it **enables interaction**  
- it **drives decision‑making**  
- it **connects systems to their environment**  
- it **starts every computation**

## a simple example

question: *why is a keyboard press input?*

first principles:
- the system detects a signal  
- the signal becomes encoded data  
- it changes what the computer does next  

so a key press is input because it **enters the system and guides behavior.**

## input summary

**input = signal entering a system → behavior influenced.**  
when information crosses into a system, it becomes input.
