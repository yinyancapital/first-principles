# technology.

## start with the basic truths
i. **humans face constraints.**  
   we lack speed, strength, memory, or reach.

ii. **tools extend capability.**  
   we build external aids to overcome limits.

iii. **systems amplify tools.**  
   connected tools multiply power.

iv. **feedback improves design.**  
   use reveals flaws; iteration creates progress.

## what is technology?

**technology** = **the intentional creation of tools and systems that extend human capability under constraints.**  
it is applied problem‑solving.

---

## how technology forms

1. **identify a limitation**  
   find the human or environmental constraint.

2. **design a tool**  
   create a method, device, or process to extend ability.

3. **embed in a system**  
   connect tools to people, workflows, and resources.

4. **iterate through feedback**  
   refine based on results and real use.

## why technology matters

- it **expands what humans can do**  
- it **reduces effort and friction**  
- it **creates new possibilities**  
- it **reshapes society and culture**

## a simple example

question: *why is a wheel technology, not just a circle?*

first principles:
- humans need to move heavy loads  
- a round shape reduces friction  
- the tool extends strength and speed  

so the wheel is technology because it **extends capability under constraints.**

## technology summary

**technology = tools + systems + purpose → extended capability.**  
when a tool amplifies what you can do, it becomes technology.
