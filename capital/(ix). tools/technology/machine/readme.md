# machine.

## start with the basic truths
i. **forces can be directed.**  
   energy can be shaped into useful motion.

ii. **structure enables function.**  
   arranged parts create capability.

iii. **repeatability creates reliability.**  
   consistent behavior is useful.

iv. **purpose defines design.**  
   machines exist to accomplish tasks.

## what is a machine?

**machine** = **an organized system of parts that transforms energy into controlled action to achieve a purpose.**  
it is structured power.

---

## how machines form

1. **define the task**  
   decide what work the machine must do.

2. **choose the energy source**  
   identify the input force (human, electric, fuel).

3. **arrange components**  
   connect parts to direct energy.

4. **stabilize and regulate**  
   ensure consistent and safe operation.

## why machines matter

- they **amplify human ability**  
- they **convert energy into work**  
- they **enable scale and speed**  
- they **make outcomes repeatable**

## a simple example

question: *why is a bicycle a machine?*

first principles:
- it converts human energy into motion  
- gears and wheels direct force  
- its structure enables repeatable travel  

so a bicycle is a machine because it **transforms energy into controlled movement.**

## machine summary

**machine = structured parts + energy → purposeful action.**  
when parts channel force into work, you have a machine.
