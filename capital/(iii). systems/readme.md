# systems — first principles

## start with the basic truths
i. **results come from connected parts.**  
   no single action stands alone.

ii. **systems shape behavior.**  
   the setup influences the outcome.

iii. **small changes compound.**  
   tiny inputs can create big shifts over time.

iv. **broken systems leak value.**  
   weak links drain time and energy.

## what are systems (first principles)?

**systems** = **connected parts that work together to produce outcomes.**

they provide:

• structure  
• flow  
• leverage

## systems across key life resources

### time
- **system use** = routines that protect focus  
- **system loss** = constant starting over  

### money
- **system use** = consistent saving and investing  
- **system loss** = income without direction  

### skills
- **system use** = structured growth loops  
- **system loss** = random practice  

### knowledge
- **system use** = capture, review, apply  
- **system loss** = forgotten insight  

### tools
- **system use** = tools that fit together  
- **system loss** = scattered workflows  

### relationships
- **system use** = habits of trust and repair  
- **system loss** = unresolved friction  

### networks
- **system use** = steady outreach and reciprocity  
- **system loss** = sporadic contact  

### energy
- **system use** = cycles of work and recovery  
- **system loss** = burnout loops  

### health
- **system use** = consistent care practices  
- **system loss** = reactive fixes

## a simple example

you want to stay fit:
- plan workouts  
- prep meals  
- sleep on schedule  

now the system supports the goal without constant willpower.

## first principles summary

**systems = connected parts that create outcomes.**  
build them well, and progress runs itself.  
ignore them, and effort leaks away.
