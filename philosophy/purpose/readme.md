# purpose — from first principles

## start with the basic truths
i. **actions need direction.**  
   without a goal, movement is random.

ii. **energy is limited.**  
   we choose where to spend attention and effort.

iii. **value creates priority.**  
   what matters most becomes the target.

iv. **continuity requires a “why.”**  
   purpose sustains action over time.

## what is purpose?

**purpose** = **a guiding aim that organizes choices, actions, and meaning.**  
it is the “why” behind what you do.

---

## how purpose forms

1. **recognize a value**  
   identify what matters deeply.

2. **choose a direction**  
   turn the value into a goal.

3. **align actions**  
   map behavior to the goal.

4. **reinforce through results**  
   outcomes strengthen the aim.

## why purpose matters

- it **focuses attention**  
- it **creates consistency**  
- it **reduces confusion**  
- it **turns effort into progress**  

---

## a simple example

question: *why does a mission outlast motivation?*

first principles:
- motivation fluctuates  
- purpose is a stable value  
- stable values guide repeated action  

so purpose lasts because it **anchors action in what matters most.**

## purpose summary

**purpose = value + direction → sustained action.**  
when you know the why, the how becomes clear.
