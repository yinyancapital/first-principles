# life.

## start with the basic truths
i. **life is finite.**  
   every being exists within limits of time and energy.

ii. **life is relational.**  
   no life unfolds in isolation from others and environment.

iii. **life is adaptive.**  
   survival and growth require continual adjustment.

iv. **life becomes meaningful through orientation.**  
   values and purpose shape how existence is lived.

## what is life?

**life** = **the finite process of being, becoming, and relating through time under real constraints.**  
it is existence in motion.

---

## how life unfolds

1. **receive conditions**  
   inherit context, limits, and possibilities.

2. **perceive and choose**  
   interpret reality and make decisions.

3. **act and adapt**  
   engage the world and adjust through feedback.

4. **form identity and contribution**  
   build character and create value for others.

5. **integrate meaning**  
   align experiences into coherent purpose.

## why life matters

- it **is the field where all value is lived**  
- it **turns principles into embodied practice**  
- it **creates the possibility of love, work, and legacy**  
- it **makes responsibility unavoidable**

## a simple example

question: *why is “being alive” different from “living well”?*

first principles:
- survival is necessary but not sufficient  
- choices shape quality and meaning  
- alignment of values and action defines lived depth

so life is more than duration; it is **the quality of becoming through chosen action.**

## life summary

**life = finite existence + choice + adaptation + meaning.**  
to live well is to align what is real with what is worthy.
