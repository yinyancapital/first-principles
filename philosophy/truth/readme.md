# truth.

## start with the basic truths
i. **reality exists independent of belief.**  
   what is true does not depend on what we want.

ii. **perception can be flawed.**  
   minds can misread reality.

iii. **consistency is a test.**  
   what is true must hold across time and context.

iv. **evidence constrains belief.**  
   claims must fit what we can observe or prove.

## what is truth?

**truth** = **a claim that accurately matches reality.**  
it is alignment between belief and what is.

---

## how truth is found

1. **form a claim**  
   state what you think is real.

2. **test against reality**  
   compare the claim to evidence or logic.

3. **check consistency**  
   see if it holds across contexts.

4. **revise when needed**  
   update beliefs when the claim fails.

## why truth matters

- it **grounds decisions** in reality  
- it **prevents self‑deception**  
- it **enables reliable knowledge**  
- it **builds trust** between minds

## a simple example

question: *is “this bridge can hold 10 tons” true?*

first principles:
- the claim is measurable  
- load testing gives evidence  
- repeated tests confirm consistency  

so the claim is true if **it consistently matches measured reality.**

## truth summary

**truth = belief aligned with reality.**  
when a claim matches what is, it is true.
