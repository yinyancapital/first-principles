# change.

## start with the basic truths

i. **reality is dynamic.**  
   conditions, people, and systems are always shifting.

ii. **stability is temporary.**  
   what works now may fail later.

iii. **adaptation preserves function.**  
   systems survive by adjusting to new conditions.

iv. **direction matters more than speed.**  
   useful change moves toward a clear aim.

## what is change?

**change** = **a meaningful shift in state, structure, or behavior over time.**  
it is the movement from one condition to another.

---

## how change works

1. **detect difference**  
   notice what has shifted.

2. **understand cause**  
   identify why the shift happened.

3. **respond deliberately**  
   choose actions that fit the new reality.

4. **stabilize and learn**  
   keep what works and update your model.

## why change matters

- it **creates risk and opportunity**  
- it **reveals weak assumptions**  
- it **forces learning and adaptation**  
- it **drives growth when directed well**

---

## a simple example

question: *why do small updates beat rare overhauls?*

first principles:
- conditions change continuously
- delayed response increases mismatch
- frequent adjustment keeps alignment

so small updates win because they keep action **synchronized with reality**.

## change summary

**change = shift over time + adaptation.**  
when you respond early and clearly, change becomes leverage.
