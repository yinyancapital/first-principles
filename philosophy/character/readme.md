# character.

## start with the basic truths

i. **actions repeat before identity hardens.**  
   what you do often becomes who you are.

ii. **values guide decisions.**  
   your priorities shape your choices under pressure.

iii. **integrity requires alignment.**  
   character is strongest when belief, word, and action match.

iv. **character is built over time.**  
   consistency matters more than single moments.

## what is character?

**character** = **the stable pattern of values and behaviors a person shows across situations, especially when tested.**  
it is who you are in practice, not only in intention.

---

## how character forms

1. **choose values**  
   define what matters most.

2. **act consistently**  
   repeat behavior that matches those values.

3. **correct quickly**  
   when you fail, repair and realign.

4. **hold under pressure**  
   true character appears when it is costly.

## why character matters

- it **builds trust** with others  
- it **stabilizes identity** through stress  
- it **guides decisions** when options are unclear  
- it **compounds reputation** over time

---

## a simple example

question: *what shows character more: promises or behavior?*

first principles:
- words can be easy
- choices under cost reveal priorities
- repeated follow-through creates trust

so character is shown most clearly through **consistent action under pressure**.

## character summary

**character = values + consistent behavior over time.**  
when actions align with principles, character becomes reliable.
