# direction.

## start with the basic truths
i. **motion without aim wastes energy.**  
   effort alone does not guarantee progress.

ii. **priorities are finite.**  
   choosing one path means declining others.

iii. **time is limited.**  
   direction determines what a life can become.

iv. **alignment sustains momentum.**  
   clear direction reduces internal conflict.

## what is direction?

**direction** = **the chosen orientation of attention, effort, and decisions toward a meaningful aim.**  
it is trajectory with intention.

---

## how direction forms

1. **clarify what matters**  
   identify core values and non-negotiables.

2. **define a target**  
   choose an aim worth sustained effort.

3. **set constraints and boundaries**  
   decide what to stop, not only what to pursue.

4. **sequence commitments**  
   align daily action with long-term intent.

5. **course-correct with feedback**  
   refine path while preserving purpose.

## why direction matters

- it **converts intention into trajectory**  
- it **prevents drift and fragmentation**  
- it **improves tradeoff quality**  
- it **multiplies meaningful effort**

## a simple example

question: *why can a busy week still feel unproductive?*

first principles:
- activity can be high without a clear aim  
- unaligned tasks consume finite energy  
- progress requires trajectory, not motion alone

so direction matters because it **turns effort into movement toward what matters.**

---

## direction summary

**direction = chosen aim + aligned action over time.**  
when your path is clear, effort compounds.
