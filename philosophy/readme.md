# philosophy.
the fundamental root of all thinking. `the love of wisdom.`

## start with the basic truths
i. **humans seek meaning.**  
   we ask why things are the way they are.

ii. **knowledge is incomplete.**  
   certainty is rare; inquiry fills the gap.

iii. **assumptions shape reality.**  
   what you believe changes how you interpret the world.

iv. **reason can refine belief.**  
   thinking clearly improves what you accept as true.

## how philosophy works

1. **ask fundamental questions**  
   about existence, knowledge, value, and mind.

2. **examine assumptions**  
   surface what is hidden beneath beliefs.

3. **use reason and logic**  
   test ideas for coherence and validity.

4. **refine or rebuild**  
   keep what holds, discard what fails.

## why philosophy matters

- it **clarifies how you think**  
- it **tests what you believe**  
- it **guides ethics and purpose**  
- it **builds frameworks for understanding**

## a simple example

question: *what makes an action “good”?*

first principles:
- actions affect beings  
- beings can suffer or flourish  
- reducing suffering and enabling flourishing are basic values  

so an action is “good” if it **reduces harm and supports flourishing.**
