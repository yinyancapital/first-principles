# meaning.

## start with the basic truths
i. **humans need orientation.**  
   we must know what matters to act.

ii. **attention is limited.**  
   we can’t care about everything equally.

iii. **value creates direction.**  
   what we value shapes what feels significant.

iv. **context gives significance.**  
   things matter relative to goals, needs, and stories.

## what is meaning?

**meaning** = **the significance something has within a context of values, goals, or understanding.**  
it is importance assigned by a mind.

## how meaning forms

1. **set a context**  
   a goal, need, or narrative defines relevance.

2. **assign value**  
   the mind ranks what matters inside that context.

3. **connect to purpose**  
   the thing gains significance by aiding or threatening the goal.

4. **stabilize through story**  
   repeated interpretation turns significance into meaning.

## a simple example

question: *why does a gift feel meaningful?*

first principles:
- there is a relationship context  
- the gift signals care or recognition  
- care aligns with a human need for connection  

so the gift is meaningful because it **reflects value within a shared context.**

## meaning summary

**meaning = value + context → significance.**  
when something serves what you care about, it becomes meaningful.
