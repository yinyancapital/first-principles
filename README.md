# first principles
What does “first principles” mean?

**First principles** means **starting from the very basic facts** and building up from there, instead of copying what everyone else says.

### A simple way to think about it:
- **Don’t start with the answer.**
- **Start with the most basic truth.**
- **Build the answer yourself.**

## A Kid‑Friendly Example: Making Lemonade

### Most people say:
“Lemonade needs sugar, water, and lemons.”

### First principles thinking asks:
1. **What is a drink?**  
   → Something you can swallow. So it needs **liquid**.
2. **Why add lemons?**  
   → For **sour flavor**.
3. **Why add sugar?**  
   → To make it **sweet**.
4. **So what is lemonade really?**  
   → A **liquid + sour + sweet**.

Now you can make “lemonade” with **different fruits** if they give sour flavor!

## Why use first principles?

- It helps you **understand things deeply**
- You can **solve new problems**
- You don’t just copy — you **create**

## Another Example: Building a Bicycle

Instead of saying “a bike has two wheels,” ask:

1. **What is the goal?**  
   → To move a person.
2. **What must it do?**  
   → Roll smoothly, be balanced, and be steerable.
3. **What parts are needed?**  
   → Wheels (to roll), frame (to hold), handlebar (to steer).

You get the bike from the **needs**, not from tradition.

## Summary (Super Short)

**First principles = break things down into basic truths and build up.**

It’s like asking:
- “What is it really?”
- “Why does it exist?”
- “What do we actually need?”
