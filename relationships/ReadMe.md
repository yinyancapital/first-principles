# relationships — first principles

## start with the basic truths
i. **people need people.**  
   connection is a basic human need.

ii. **relationships are built, not found.**  
   they grow through time and shared experience.

iii. **trust is the core currency.**  
   without trust, connection stays shallow.

iv. **neglect breaks bonds.**  
   what isn’t cared for weakens.
