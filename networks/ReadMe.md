# networks — first principles

## start with the basic truths
i. **people are connected.**  
   no one succeeds alone.

ii. **connections carry value.**  
   trust, knowledge, and opportunity move through them.

iii. **weak ties can open big doors.**  
   distant connections often bring new information.

iv. **networks grow or decay.**  
   they strengthen with care or fade with neglect.

### time
- **network use** = saving time through shared insight  
- **network loss** = solving alone and repeating mistakes  

### money
- **network use** = access to jobs, deals, and capital  
- **network loss** = fewer options and slower growth  

### skills
- **network use** = learning from others  
- **network loss** = isolated skill growth  

### knowledge
- **network use** = faster access to better information  
- **network loss** = outdated understanding  

### tools
- **network use** = borrowing and sharing tools  
- **network loss** = paying full cost alone  

### relationships
- **network use** = broader trust and collaboration  
- **network loss** = narrow support  

### energy

you want a new job:
